Abstract
----------
This project aims to create application with different departments within the university.

First, the consumer department sets the targets, analyzes them.

Second, the design department draws the application, makes PERSONA and wireframe based on pre-step.

Third, the embedded and the electronic engineering departments are make the application using tools.

The targets are twenties. We foces on their spare time.

As a result, Our application is a drum beatsmaker to use puzzle pieces, using target's leisure time.

Reserch

We identify problems through interviews and observations.


Our subject's common feature is using smartphone in their leisure time. Also, they released stress to watch the video and to listen the music. So, We thought that the application that reliees the visual and the aural needs.

Draw app design, Make PERSONA
-------------------------

The visual effect indicate using puzzle pieces, if pieces assemble with other that play the music. However, piano and guitar have  too many note. It is hard to make viual object in this project. So, we think that drum is proper instrument because drum beats are limit. After, we make the PERSONA who spend the time using smartphone. 


Make WireFrame
